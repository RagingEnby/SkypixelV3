# What Is Skypixel
Skypixel is a Discord bot I have worked on and off on for a couple years now. It's made to assist with item collecting in Hypixel SkyBlock.

Originally, Skypixel was made as a frontend to search through spreadsheets from [iTEM](https://tem.cx/) in the same style as [TEMBot](https://discord.com/users/937105508320546896)'s `/spook-search` command. However, over time it evolved into much more.

# History
- SkypixelV1 was HORRIBLY coded with abysmal performance, near constant crashes, and a level beyond spagetti code.
- SkypixelV2 was never finished as I lost interest before finishing it. Then, upon coming back to it, I realized just how bad the code was again!
- SkypixelV3 is, hopefully, the final full recode of Skypixel made to fix all of these problems.

# Future
- Impliment a mineflayer bot to monitor when alpha opens/closes and when the kick message changes
- Eventually, I will make SkypixelV4 which will be done fully in GOLANG.
